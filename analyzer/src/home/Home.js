                    Where did you go wrong? Where did you go right? The answers are in your game log, but they aren't very easy to find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until now. Win Dominion parses your game log and provides a beautiful interface for post-game analysis. Drag the turn slider and visually watch the decks grow and shrink
                    as you "rewind" and "fast forward" through your game. View statistics about each deck's contents for each turn. Use the full potential of your game's data to fine tune your strategy.

                    After playing a game, just click the <img alt="Chrome Extension" src={ChromeExtIcon} style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', marginTop: '-3px'}} /> icon and your analysis will automatically open in a new tab!

                    Using the Chrome extension is <i>highly</i> recommended. It sends Win Dominion more data about your game, giving you a more accurate analysis and helping us further refine this software.
